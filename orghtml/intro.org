[[https://github.com/demon386/Neverland][Neverland]] is a static blog generator written in Clojure, with the intention of working with Emacs Org mode in mind. Neverland extracts the HTML file generated by Org mode's export functionality, with the [[https://github.com/cgrand/enlive][enlive]] library.

I'm relatively new to Clojure and Web programming, so this work is still very primitive.
