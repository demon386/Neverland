#+TITLE: Neverland - Static blog generator with Clojure
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
[[https://github.com/demon386/Neverland][Neverland]] is a static blog generator written in Clojure, with the intention of working with Emacs Org mode in mind. Neverland extracts the HTML file generated by Org mode's export functionality.

I'm relatively new to Clojure and Web programming, so this work is still very primitive.
