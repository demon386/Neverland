#+TITLE: Neverland - Static blog generator with Clojure
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
Neverland is a static blog generator written in Clojure, with the intention of working with Emacs org-mode in mind. Neverland extracts the HTML file generated by Org-mode's export functionality.

I'm relatively new to Clojure and Web programming, so this work is still very primitive.
