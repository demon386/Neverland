# Introduction
Neverland is a static blog generator written in Clojure, with the intention of working with Emacs org-mode in mind. Neverland extracts the HTML file generated with Org-mode's export functionality.

I'm relatively new to Clojure and Web programming, so this work is *very primitive*.

[My personal Blog](http://www.mtong.me) is genereated with it.
