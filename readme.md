# Introduction
Neverland is a static blog generator written in Clojure, with the intention of working with Emacs Org mode in mind. Neverland extracts the HTML file generated by Org mode's export functionality, with the [enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) library.

I'm relatively new to Clojure and Web programming, so this work is still *very primitive*.

The example site in the folder is [My personal Blog](http://www.mtong.me), which is built with [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
